Post: Ancestry.com - is it safe? Hello!: ) I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me. Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences? Thank you! If my English isn't perfect, that's because I'm not a native speaker.
Response: Let's think step by step.",false,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to determine if the given post suffers from depression. The options are True or False. The post is about Ancestry.com and concerns about safety, credit card information, and whether it's suspicious. The person is a new user and feels uncomfortable sharing their credit card details.

First, I need to check if the post shows emotional distress or depressive symptoms. The main points are the concern about the trial period requiring credit card info, which makes the person feel uneasy. They mention being unsure if they're being too doubtful and ask for others' experiences. 

Depression typically involves persistent sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in activities. The post here is more about anxiety and concern about security, not necessarily sadness or hopelessness. The person is worried about their own safety and the reliability of the service, but there's no mention of feeling down, losing interest in life, or prolonged sadness. 

The example given earlier had a post about a rough year, which clearly indicated depression. In this case, the post is more about a specific concern related to a service, not a general emotional state. Therefore, the answer should be False because there's no indication of depression.
</think>

Response: Let's think step by step. The post discusses concerns about a service's security and a specific worry about sharing personal information, but it does not express persistent sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest in life. The emotional tone is more about anxiety and concern rather than depressive symptoms.  
Answer: False"

Post: Dini ticaret haline getirenler
Response: Let's think step by step.",false,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to determine if the given post suffers from depression. The post is in Turkish: ""Dini ticaret haline getirenler"". First, I need to understand what this means. ""Dini ticaret"" translates to ""religious commerce"" or ""religion-based business"". The phrase ""haline getirenler"" means ""those who bring about"" or ""those who cause"". So the post is saying that those who bring about religious commerce are... something. 

Now, the user is asking if this post shows depression. Depression is typically characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, low mood, or other emotional symptoms. But the post is a statement about religious commerce. There's no mention of emotional distress, sadness, or any negative emotions. The content is neutral or even positive, discussing a topic related to business or religion. 

The example given earlier had a post about a rough year, which clearly indicated emotional distress. In this case, there's no mention of personal struggles, sadness, or hopelessness. The post is factual or descriptive, not expressing an emotional state. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for depression as per the example. 

So the answer should be False.

Post: My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?
Response: Let's think step by step.",true,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the given post suffers from depression. The answer should be True or False.

First, I need to analyze the post. The user provided a long, detailed narrative about the author's mother's family. The post is filled with a lot of emotional distress and tragic events. The author mentions multiple deaths, family dysfunction, and a sense of being overwhelmed by the family's不幸 (unluckiness). 

The key points are the numerous tragedies: twins killed in a car accident, another twin killed in a boat accident, the grandfather's death, the older brothers' drug problems and subsequent deaths, and the author's mother's family being left with only a few members who have positive lives. The author also expresses a sense of despair, calling the situation ""depressing as fuck."" 

The response from the assistant in the example was True because the post showed significant emotional distress. The current post is similar in that it's filled with a series of tragic events, family loss, and a sense of helplessness. The author's tone is very negative, discussing the family's dysfunction and the author's own feelings of being overwhelmed. 

I need to check if there's any ambiguity. The post is clearly about the author's mother's family's tragic history, which leads to a sense of depression. The author's own feelings of being ""gobsmacked"" and ""depressing as fuck"" support the conclusion. There's no mention of hope or positive elements that would counteract the depression. 

Therefore, the answer should be True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post details a series of tragic, emotionally distressing events involving the author's mother's family. It includes multiple deaths, family dysfunction, and a sense of overwhelming despair. The author expresses feelings of helplessness, grief, and frustration, using phrases like ""depressing as fuck"" and ""tragic loss."" These elements strongly indicate a significant emotional burden and a depressive state. The post does not contain any positive or uplifting elements that would mitigate the sense of depression.

Post: A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me"" half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his."" and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.
Response: Let's think step by step.",false,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this post suffers from depression. The user wants me to determine if the post is an example of depression, with the answer being either True or False.

First, I need to understand the content of the post. The person is talking about their friend having days off and planning a catch-up. They mention that they want to meet but are concerned about not stepping on any toes. The friend changes the plans, asking to move the meeting to another day, even though the person's only day off is Tuesday. The person feels like they're being put on the backburner and not a priority. They also mention it's getting to them and that it's sucking.

Now, I need to check if this is indicative of depression. Depression is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, and other symptoms. The post mentions feeling put on the backburner, which could be a sign of frustration or stress. However, the person is also talking about a specific situation with a friend, not necessarily a persistent emotional state. The key here is whether the post reflects a depressive episode or just a situational stress.

The person is expressing dissatisfaction with their friend's plans and feeling neglected. But they're not necessarily expressing a deep, ongoing sadness or hopelessness. They might be feeling upset about a specific event, not necessarily depressed. However, the mention of feeling ""sucks"" and being put on the backburner could be part of a depressive mood. But the post doesn't mention any persistent negative thoughts or a lack of interest in activities. It's more about a specific situation causing distress.

So, the answer might be False because the post is about a specific interpersonal conflict rather than a depressive episode. The user's example had more emotional distress, but this one is about a situation where the person feels neglected. The answer depends on whether the post shows depression symptoms. Since the person is expressing frustration but not necessarily a depressive state, the answer is False.
</think>

Response: Let's think step by step. The post describes a specific interpersonal conflict where the person feels neglected and stressed about their friend's plans. While there is emotional distress, the content does not indicate a persistent depressive state or deep hopelessness. The focus is on a situational issue rather than a chronic emotional condition.

Post: I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.
Response: Let's think step by step.",false,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the post suffers from depression. The answer should be True or False.

First, I need to read the post carefully. The post is about someone reflecting on whether they want kids, considering their current opinion and future possibilities. They mention they don't see themselves wanting kids now, but are unsure about the future. They also talk about not seeing kids as right or wrong, just wanting to know if they'll stay the same.

Now, I need to determine if this is depressive. Depression often involves persistent sadness, hopelessness, or emotional distress. The post shows a lot of self-reflection and uncertainty, which can be signs of depression. The person is dealing with internal conflict and questioning their own decisions, which might indicate emotional distress. However, the post doesn't explicitly mention symptoms like persistent sadness or hopelessness. It's more about self-exploration and uncertainty. 

But the example given in the prompt had a post about a rough year, which was clearly emotional distress. This post is more about personal decision-making and future uncertainty. It's possible that the person is experiencing anxiety or stress related to their future plans, which could be a sign of depression. However, without explicit mention of depression symptoms, it's a bit tricky. 

The key here is whether the post shows signs of depression. The person is dealing with a significant life decision, which can be stressful. The uncertainty and self-doubt might be part of depression. But maybe it's just a normal introspection. 

In the example, the response was True because the post showed emotional distress. This post is similar in that it's about personal feelings and future plans, which can be a sign of depression. So, I think the answer is True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post reflects on personal decisions (having kids) and future uncertainties, showing self-reflection and emotional distress. The individual is grappling with conflicting thoughts and questioning their own future desires, which can indicate significant emotional turmoil. While not explicitly diagnosable, the content suggests a deep internal struggle, aligning with the criteria for depression.

Post: Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy.
Response: Let's think step by step.",true,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to determine if the given post suffers from depression. The answer should be True or False.

First, I need to analyze the post. The user wrote: ""Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy.""

So the person is talking about feeling like they're not good at anything, having failed at everything they've tried, and feeling like they need to find something that gives them happiness and fulfillment. They mention being good at nothing and having tried years of things without success. The tone is negative, expressing frustration and a sense of helplessness. 

Depression is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities. The post does express a lot of negative emotions and a sense of failure. The person is not engaging in activities they enjoy and is struggling with their self-worth. The mention of ""I've failed at everything"" and the desire to find something meaningful suggests a deep sense of despair. 

The example given in the prompt had a similar structure, and the response was True. So applying that logic here, the post seems to indicate depression. The key points are the persistent failure, lack of interest in activities, and the feeling of being stuck. Therefore, the answer should be True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post expresses a profound sense of failure, frustration, and helplessness, with the individual feeling they are ""good at absolutely nothing"" and struggling to find meaning or fulfillment. The repeated use of ""I've failed"" and the desire to ""devote myself to something"" suggests a deep emotional struggle and a lack of motivation or hope. These elements are hallmark symptoms of depression.

Post: Anyone want to talk with me tonight? Just lonely, need to get out of my head.
Response: Let's think step by step.",true,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to determine if the given post suffers from depression. The post says, ""Anyone want to talk with me tonight? Just lonely, need to get out of my head."" 

First, I need to analyze the content. The person is expressing loneliness and feeling stuck in their head. These are common symptoms associated with depression. However, I should check if there's more than just these symptoms. The post doesn't mention any specific thoughts, suicide, or other severe issues. It's more about feeling lonely and needing to escape their thoughts.

The example given in the prompt had a post about a rough year, which was clearly emotional distress. Here, the post is more about loneliness and being stuck. But is that enough to classify as depression? Depression can have various symptoms, but the key is whether the post shows a significant emotional distress that's persistent and severe.

The person is asking for a talk, which might indicate they're seeking support, but the presence of loneliness and being stuck in their head are signs. However, without more context, like persistent feelings of hopelessness or a lack of interest in activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the information, the post does express emotional distress and loneliness, which are key indicators. So the answer would be True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post mentions feeling lonely and needing to get out of one's head, which are common symptoms of depression. While the post does not explicitly state a diagnosis, the emotional distress and persistent feelings of loneliness are significant indicators. The request for a talk suggests a need for support, which is often associated with depression.

Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what’s the point of even living anymore.""

Breaking it down. The person is expressing a lot of negative emotions. They mention feeling that no one cares, accepting their thoughts, realizing things won't get better. They have a cycle of playing video games, mourning, using weed, listening to sad songs, and life being a boring shit show. Talking to people makes them feel worse because they mess things up. They even question the point of living.

These are all signs of depression. The person is feeling hopeless, having a cycle of negative behaviors, and questioning their life's purpose. The language used is very emotional and despairing. The example given in the prompt was similar, and the response was True. So, applying the same logic here, the answer should be True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post expresses deep emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness, self-deprecation, and a sense of meaninglessness. The individual describes a cycle of negative behaviors (video games, substance use, sad songs) and a pervasive sense that life is ""boring"" and ""worthless."" The tone is despairing, with the person questioning their purpose and feeling isolated. These are hallmark symptoms of depression.

Post: How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.) So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore. She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way. Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her. For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday. (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.) After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her. In sum, I just decided to protect myself.
Response: Let's think step by step.",false,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out if this post is an example of depression. The user wants to know if the post shows signs of depression, and the answer should be True or False.

First, I need to read the post carefully. The person is talking about ending a friendship, feeling frustrated, and dealing with a friend who's being unreasonable. They mention that their friend is ""crazy"" and that they're having a rough time. They also talk about their own coping mechanisms, like posting passive-aggressive memes, which they say helps them, but they're afraid to speak because their friend might take it the wrong way.

The post seems to express a lot of emotional distress. They're dealing with a difficult relationship, feeling isolated, and having to deal with their friend's negative behavior. There's a sense of frustration and maybe even sadness. The mention of ""rough time"" and ""coping by posting memes"" suggests that they're struggling with their emotions and trying to manage them through certain methods.

The user's response in the example said ""True"" because the post showed significant emotional distress. In this case, the post is about a friendship issue, personal struggles, and emotional coping mechanisms. The person is expressing their feelings about the friend's behavior, their own feelings of being overwhelmed, and their decision to distance themselves. There's a lot of emotional intensity here, which aligns with depression symptoms like persistent sadness, hopelessness, and difficulty in daily life.

I should check if there are any signs of depression in the text. The person is talking about their own emotional state, the impact of their friend's behavior, and the effort to cope. They mention being ""afraid to speak"" and ""not interested in what she has to say,"" which could indicate a lack of social support or feelings of isolation. The post doesn't mention any specific medical conditions or professional help, but the emotional content is strong enough to suggest depression.

So, based on the analysis, the answer should be True.
</think>

Let's think step by step. The post discusses a difficult friendship, emotional distress from a friend's behavior, and coping strategies. It highlights feelings of frustration, isolation, and a sense of being overwhelmed. The person expresses a desire to protect themselves from toxic relationships and acknowledges their own emotional struggles. These elements indicate significant emotional distress and a lack of social support, which are common in depression. The post does not mention specific medical conditions or professional help but conveys a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness.

Post: Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello, I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week ."" I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family. I really do not know what to think... My friends say fuck her move on. I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good. I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help. Cheers, Your Reddit friend.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to determine if the given post suffers from depression. The answer should be True or False.

First, I need to read the post carefully. The post is from someone who's been through a tough time with their girlfriend. They mention the girlfriend having depression, which is a key point. The person is in a long-term relationship, and the girlfriend has been slipping into an abyss of depression. They talk about the girlfriend's symptoms, like feeling lost, smok­ing weed, eating too much, and going to sleep early. There's a lot of emotional distress here.

The person is also expressing their own feelings of hurt and confusion. They mention the girlfriend's breakdown, the attempts to help, and the lack of progress. The post includes a lot of emotional turmoil, self-doubt, and a sense of helplessness. The user is asking if the post shows depression, and the example given in the prompt had similar content with True.

Looking at the details: the girlfriend's depression is mentioned, the person is struggling with their own emotions, and there's a sense of hopelessness and frustration. The post is filled with emotional pain, longing for connection, and a desire for help. The person is also showing self-awareness about their own feelings, which is a sign of depression. 

The response from the example was True because the post showed significant emotional distress. Similarly, this post has a lot of emotional distress, including the girlfriend's depression, the person's own struggles, and the lack of progress in helping. The post also includes elements like the girlfriend's withdrawal, the person's attempts to reach out, and the emotional impact on the person. 

I don't see any signs that the post is about depression in a general sense. The person is discussing their own emotional state and the girlfriend's condition, but the main focus is on their own feelings of despair and the difficulty in helping. The post is more about the person's experience and their emotional state rather than a general statement about depression. However, the presence of depression in the girlfriend's condition and the person's emotional state is a strong indicator. 

But the question is whether the post itself suffers from depression. The post is about the person's experience, including their own depression. The person is expressing their own emotional distress, which is a sign of depression. Therefore, the answer should be True.

Let's think step by step. The post describes a person's emotional struggle with a girlfriend who is experiencing depression. The narrator expresses deep feelings of sadness, frustration, and helplessness, including details about the girlfriend's symptoms (e.g., smok­ing weed, eating too much, and going to sleep early). The person is also reflecting on their own emotional state, questioning their ability to help and feeling isolated. The post includes self-doubt, longing for connection, and a sense of despair, all of which are hallmark signs of depression. The narrative is filled with emotional distress and a lack of hope, which aligns with the criteria for depression. 

Answer: True"
