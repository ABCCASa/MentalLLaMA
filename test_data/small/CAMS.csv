"I'm 29 years old and here I am another New Year's Eve with my parents. So it's thirtieth time that I'm spending my New Year's Eve with my parents. They are old and tired dad is 60yo and mom is 58yo and I'm also so tired of everything I never had any true friends, never had girlfriend, finished crappy high school, quit college on third year because of loneliness and depression. Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough.

"Hi. Nice to meet you. I am a loser. A complete nobody that never gets noticed by others. I feel very insecure about myself. Too ugly, too boring, too awkward.

"And instead of enjoying the break, I want to be here less. 

I had maybe one hour of reflection all week where I felt grateful for this job. Grateful to be making $30k out of college. 

But then I fell asleep and was back it by morning. How working full time @ 24 won't allow me to survive on my own. 

Who am I kidding...making more money wouldn't let me survive on my own cause I'd still be depressed.

"I hate staying at University accommodation. I haven’t made any real friends and I constantly feel homesick.

I’m not severely depressed, it’s more of prolonged mild depression so I think I have Dysthymia. Can’t be certain though because I haven’t spoken to a professional yet.

Every morning I wake up dreading the thought of going into work, spending 6 hours walking around a shop floor, only to end up with another 7/8 hours left until I sleep again.

There’s only so much I can do in the day and it doesn’t help that I procrastinate. I have exams soon and I haven’t even started revising. I hate myself for being so lazy and idiotic.

I just want to be at home. Or somewhere where I am surrounded my family and people I like. People who are on the same wavelength as me, who share my interests and have stuff in common.

I have numerous days were I am happy but then I just get back home and feel so depressed because it was a one-off.

Sometimes I just have these thoughts where I think that death would get rid of everything. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I died. Though I don’t want to carry out these thoughts, but these thoughts are often.

I just don’t want to be alone anymore, and I don’t know what to do.",jobs and career,"The post mentions feeling homesick in their university accommodation and not having made any real friends, indicating a sense of alienation and loneliness.

"I never knew my father he left before i was born. My mother told me he started a charity for boys without father's after he left that and his first name is all i know about him. Four years ago my mom and stepfather made a move overseas from my home country. The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships.

Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

It's hard being alone or feeling that way I've always wanted to meet someone my own age I dream of it. Some days i wake up and I'll sneak out of the house to the park and hope to meet someone. I haven't yet. My 18th birthday is happening this year and that's a big number to me but I'm afraid nothing is going to change its like I'm stuck in a purgatory while everyone else gets to go to school and have friends get a job. 

I'm in a village with a handful of houses in a country i wasnt born in. I have dreams and I even turned my room into a little acomplishement zone to achieve mini goals so that one day I'll be able to accomplish those dreams.

Sometimes things just seem unfair i feel like I'm chipping away at a granite wall with a plastic spoon. My parents dont listen for years i begged them for an activity or something to give me growth and interaction with other kids it never happened. What's the purpose for all this happening why have i been put in a time of obscurity for this long?

Sorry for the rant has anyone had a similar experience of being alone like this. I'm sure alot of people who grew up homeschooled experienced what im feeling.",relationship,"The post describes the poster's feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as their desire for relationships and connections with others.

"ive had this sentence typed: im so goddamn tired of

and i keep typing things im tired of, then backspacing. things like how im tired of being incredibly lazy and not doing something constructive. or how im tired that i draw like absolute shit and am truly at the bottom rung of a hierarchy of artists. tired of hating me.

"I’m proud of my accomplishments but I always second guess everything.  What if I did this differently? Why didn’t I do this better?  It’s gotten to the point where I compare myself to my colleagues and friends and their successes and motivations. I want to be motivated into achieving more but thoughts of inadequacy has kept me in a state of stagnation. How do I convince myself to be ok with where I’m at in life and gain the motivation to move forward? I feel so ashamed to have these feelings yet so jealous of the happiness and enjoyment my friends have in the things we do. Because of this I feel isolated and alone in my feelings and unsure of my future. I love my friends and family but I’ve never seen them as the type of people to have serious conversations about my distress with and I don’t want their perception of me to change if I tell them. I’ve had people in my life call me broken and recently I’ve started to feel that way. How do I become enjoy life again?

"Alone at New Year's Eve. I remembered that my friends were on their sides, partying with their friends, and I'm not even here. I drank a beer earlier to have some sort of fun... but I don't feel like drinking the second one I bought. 

And I felt empty... I took my pocket knife, washed it, and started cutting on my right arm. Strange thing is, I'm right-handed, but I've always cut with my left hand. Now I feel like I'm 16 again. And I feel like an idiot. But I needed to see I was still living. If I can feel pain, I'm worth living, right? I don't even know anymore. Now it burns like fuck and I feel like an idiot.",none,"The post does not suggest that the poster has experienced bias or abuse, job-related stress, medication-related side effects, relationship issues, or a sense of alienation from others as contributing factors to their behavior."
