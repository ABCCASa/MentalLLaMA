I didn't kill myself bc of this song pic.twitter.com/kffmJTpubz,suicide or self-harm,The use of the phrase 'I didn't kill myself' immediately suggests that the person is struggling with suicidal ideation or has at least thought about it. This type of statement is a strong indicator of a suicide or self-harm tendency.
Sad to hear the news @dickc @Twitter. You have great and will be missed by all your friends and supporters @Unilever pic.twitter.com/HjSaN4mBmp,no mental disorder,"The same reasoning as before can be applied in this case. The post shows condolences to someone who has passed away, but there is no indication of any significant distress or symptoms of a mental disorder. The use of the word 'sad' can indicate a low mood, but it does not necessarily imply a mental disorder."
Baby stingrays look like raviolis stuffed with tiny damned souls pic.twitter.com/XqtSnYWq9b,no mental disorder,This post is simply making a humorous comparison between baby stingrays and raviolis. There is no indication of any distress or symptoms of a mental disorder present in the post.
"i am more and more proud of you every single day. you do so much for everyone you meet, and i bet when you meet a fan you acknowledge that +",no mental disorder,"This post shows admiration and pride for someone else, which does not necessarily indicate any symptoms of a mental disorder. The person is expressing support and appreciation for someone they admire and suggesting that the person they admire also shows kindness to their fans. There is no indication of distress, low mood, or any other symptoms that would suggest a mental disorder."
@c2nh8qaVDFPq I asked Zak same question. Since I was diagnosed with cancer I'm more sensitive to spirits. Is this common? Thanks!,no mental disorder,"This post mentions being diagnosed with cancer and being more sensitive to spirits. While it could be a sign of heightened emotions or sensitivity due to the stress of a cancer diagnosis, there is no indication that it would meet the criteria for PTSD or any other mental disorder. The mention of spirits could be related to personal beliefs or experiences, but it does not necessarily suggest a mental disorder."
"RT @bDi3R_sNY: @rQhusgWeEVi If this tweet get's 100 RTs, would you follow me back? A follow will make my day way better. I love you! xx",depression,"The reasoning for assigning the label of depression to this post is as follows:
- The author of the post is seeking validation through asking for retweets as a condition for receiving a follow back. This indicates a desire for external recognition and validation, which can be characteristic of individuals with depression.
- The statement that a follow would make their day better suggests that the person is likely experiencing low mood or negative emotions, which are common symptoms of depression.
- Expressing love towards the person they are addressing can be seen as an attempt to seek connection and affection, which is another common aspect of depression.
- The use of ""xx"" as a sign-off can indicate a compensatory behavior for the lack of physical affection, another characteristic of depression.
Overall, while the post may not explicitly mention sadness or hopelessness, the implicit messages and behaviors suggest that the person who wrote it is struggling with depression."
"RT @eEUcMLsJuWV9ew: Hey guys bad news, its illegal now to tweet the words ""a little drunk on you and high on summertime"" bummer yea but its…",depression,"There is no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm in the post, and the content does not suggest any significant distress or trigger any symptoms of a mental disorder. While the post mentions ""bad news"" and a bummer, it does not provide enough information to warrant labeling it as a mental health concern. Therefore, the assigned label would be ""No mental disorders."""
"Que bonito día en México DF, gracias a todos por venir a vernos y darnos tanto cariño! Sois geniales!",no mental disorder,"This post is in Spanish and translates to ""Such a beautiful day in Mexico City, thank you all for coming to see us and giving us so much love! You are amazing!"" There is no indication of any mental disorders in this post. It simply expresses gratitude and positive emotions about a day spent in Mexico City."
A damning report out on the unprovoked killings by Nigeria's military on unarmed Shia muslims in Zaria fb.me/4IM6OMX5q,no mental disorder,"This post appears to be sharing news of unprovoked killings by Nigeria's military on unarmed Shia Muslims in Zaria. While the subject matter is distressing and could elicit emotional responses, there is no specific indication of any mental disorder. The post seems to be focused on sharing information and raising awareness about a particular issue, rather than reflecting any personal mental health concerns."
"RT @r4G2hocwifn7: ICYMI: Arkansas State RB Michael Gordon lands on pile, alertly keeps playing &amp; runs for 70-yard TD. VIDEO: http://t.co/twhttp://t.co/y1vL_iQTZo",no mental disorder,This post is about a football play and does not contain any indicators of mental distress or symptoms of a mental disorder. It seems to be a straightforward retweet of a sports highlight and does not suggest any mental health concerns.
