post,aspect,label,reason
I feel like everyone just doesn't appreciate me. And I only feel this because of school. My teacher told me today that if I didn't do anything that would be more helpful than me actually trying to do something. I'm only 10 and I feel like no one my age should be feeling like this. I know you people are much older and have to deal with way worse problems but when your a goddamn 5th grader life shouldn't make you feel like your worthless. My entire day was filled with unfairness. Teachers have their favorites and if you aren't one of them you'll be treated like shit.,spiritual,false,"In the post, the individual expresses feelings of being unappreciated and mistreated, particularly in the context of school. While these feelings may indicate a lack of emotional well-being, there is no indication of a search for meaning or purpose in human existence. The focus is on interpersonal relationships and the unfairness of the individual's experiences. Therefore, the post does not reflect the wellness dimension of the spiritual aspect as defined by Dunn's model."
