"Suicidal, but won't do it. Just need someone to talk to me.",suicide,The use of the phrase 'suicidal' immediately suggests that the person is struggling with suicidal ideation or has at least thought about it.
"A lie. A lie ruined my life A lie. A lie ruined my life. There comes a time in every kids life when they are faced with the moral challenge…. Do I lie? Do I tell the truth? In most of those scenarios, the consequence of either will make the kid lean towards one side or the other. Do I tell the truth and get yelled at? Do I tell a lie and escape punishment? I chose to lie. I chose to lie again. I chose to lie again and again and again. Don’t get me wrong…I didn’t always lie. Don’t get it wrong… A sometimes-liar, is still a liar. - I was a teenager in love. *eye-roll* No, but seriously. I was in LOVE. She had everything I had ever hoped and dreamed of in the perfect girl. Nice hair, nice eyes, super pretty…who am I kidding, my teenage mind thought this girl was SMOKING. And she is. We started talking. You wouldn’t believe it but she came on to me. I know I previously stated that I was a sometimes-liar…but I shit you not… This girl liked me. I asked her out to homecoming I asked her to be my girlfriend She said yes She said yes We were the perfect couple. *As labeled by the senior class newspaper Were we the perfect couple? I would say so… With one major exception. I lied. There comes a time in every relationship where its going to be difficult to tell your partner the truth. You don’t believe me? Just wait. In most scenarios, the outcome will make a person lean one way or the other. Do I tell the truth and get yelled at? Possibly broken up with? Or Do I lie, and promise myself to never do it again? In this situation, I got caught. There was no way out of it. Did I come clean? I’m ashamed to say that I didn’t I lied I lied to her beautiful, innocent face It didn’t work. I told her the truth, eventually. But is there any honor in that? There is some honor in telling the truth in those situations. When you are FORCED to be truthful, it gets taken away. She forgave me, eventually. But she did not forget. - She went off to college It was a no brainer, we were going to stay together… forever. We had our differences We began to grow in our different ways But we made it work. Year after year. Struggle after struggle. Little lie, after little lie i forgive you Please don’t do it again Please don’t break my heart. i love you I won’t I love you too I did. I don’t have an excuse for what I did. I didn’t cheat on her. I didn’t kill anyone. But I did lie to her We were high school sweethearts We dated through college I constantly thought about how I would propose… Would I sing? Would it be at the beach? Would I have her family there? Should I wait a year or two after her graduation? How should I ask her? Oh man… I have to ask her parents for permission… Damn it I can’t wait. This is going to be perfect. She is perfect. A lie. A lie ruined my life. There comes a time in every man’s life when they are faced with the moral challenge…. Do I lie? Do I tell the truth? I chose to lie She chose to say goodbye I’m ashamed. This is a flaw that I knew I had. The little white lie that I told as a kid, it snowballed. The infamous nasty habit, became a nasty habit of mine. It defined me. It defined my breakup. Do I accept this as my way of life? fuck no. There comes a time in every man’s life when he has to choose to grow out of childish habits. What some forget is that you have to stay conscious of the fact that you have these habits. Otherwise, you go back to your nasty ways. I chose to make this decision today Again I chose to make this decision too late Again I can only hope that this beautiful girl will forgive me I can only hope that God finds me worthy of her forgiveness I can only hope",no mental disorder,"The post primarily focuses on the speaker's personal experiences and reflections on lying within relationships.

"Suicidal Thoughts and Venting I would first like to start off by saying that, if I could, I would not want to die or cease my existence I would want to be happy and not feel like things are crashing down on me, but I can’t feel anything besides consistent despair. On the outside, I may look successful. I earned a college degree at the age of 18, and I’ve worked for UNC, one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. I have my own apartment at the age of 20, and I have a loving family and a puppy who keeps me company. I am also supposed to be a good Christian girl, and I used to attend the local Coptic church regularly. Beyond my sunny exterior, like I said earlier, I only have dread. I have hated the fact that I have these mean voices in my head telling me that no one truly cares about me. I have hated the fact that I was so insecure about my weight, and have tried to starve myself to stay skinny: if I ate, I would try anything in my power to regurgitate the food that I ate. I have hated the fact that I have stopped attending classes at UNC, going to church, going to therapy, and going to work like I used to. All I can bear to do now is to sell my own body for work, and drink to ease the pain. The reason why? That’s the only way I have known to ever feel loved. I was raped since the age of 16 until just recently, and every single day I subconsciously have felt that if no one loves how I look or calls me beautiful that I am worthless. You may ask why I cannot go to my parents or anybody from my church to ask for help. The thing is, I feel as if I don’t deserve their help. My parents did not choose to have a daughter like me who has went through so much. People from my church are good people while I am a wretched human being who has done so many horrible things. Besides, I am sure they know that I am not like them. I do all sorts of evil sins, so I would definitely be far from being a good child of God. I am tormented daily. In the morning, by my lack of desire to get up and be productive. At night, by my consistent nightmares. It is all just torture. If I can disappear from existence and not have to experience the pain of death, I would have done it. Right now, I am just trying to decide if disappearing from existence is worth experiencing the pain of death.",suicide,"The post explicitly mentions having suicidal thoughts and feeling consistent despair. The individual also describes experiencing significant mental and emotional distress, as well as engaging in harmful behaviors such as starving themselves, self-harm, and engaging in risky behaviors.

"Guided Meditation Disclaimer: I am in no way saying meditation should be the sole method of treating bipolar disorder. I wouldn't be stable enough to meditate without my meds. Just sharing an experience. I attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful. My mind has been racing for days. Just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts. 25 minutes in a dimly-lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice. My mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away. PTSD tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger; bipolar disorder tells me I can't sit still (mentally or physically) long enough to get through a guided meditation. But get through it I did, and it was very helpful. It was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost $5. If you're interested in meditation, it might be something to check out in your area. Just my experience.",bipolar,"The post mentions having bipolar disorder and describes symptoms that are commonly associated with the condition, such as racing thoughts and difficulty sitting still mentally or physically.

Effexor day 1 is going badly Good news! So the nausea has died away. Bad news... Someone knocked at the door and was acting weird so I went into full panic mode. I'm worried that the owners of the abused dog I'm fostering will come round or send over goons which is why I went to the doc for something. I'm not too sure he was right to put me on a/d instead of something prn. I ran around the house making sure all windows are locked. I set up an old phone in the front door window recording video. I've got a hammer by the back door and exit plans for all contingencies. But I can't relax. My heart is going a mile a minute. My stomach is in even more knots than before and my breathing is more shallow. Bleugh! Update - and I just got a threatening message from the not so nice lady who caused criminal damage to my door. Just when the anxiety starts going down they spike it back up.,anxiety,"The post includes multiple descriptions and symptoms commonly associated with anxiety, such as experiencing panic mode, worrying about potential threats, engaging in safety behaviors (locking windows, setting up video recording, having an exit plan), and physical symptoms like rapid heart rate, stomach knots, and shallow breathing.

"I wanted to send you this but a voice in my head told me not to We all have another voice in our head who hates us. Who puts us down tries to sedate us. Who likes to cuss and make a fuss and overall you dont like him much and he doesnt like you. Its a voice I hear. Im no stranger to the fear of his word inside my head, but I hear him clear. As clear as I hear your words. Vibrating in your head as you read these words that form from my head to yours. My own translated to a phone, from me to you to me I am gone. Left escribed on a wall of text. A wall of thought. That is heard as loud as sound thats brought and you hear a voice as loud as silence in drought on a rainless season. You hear yourself but I am speaking. You wonder what is wrought, ask now or maybe not, close your ears or your eyes. Maybe instead you just get I Maybe just get I need help and so do you so do i.

Maybe I should say why not.",depression,"The post contains several mentions of negative self-perception, a voice in the head that puts the individual down, and a sense of feeling unheard or not understood by others.

"i need advice. my home team can’t spare anyone to come and see me AGAIN and are telling me to go to A&amp;E i know how A&amp;E staff treat psych patients taking up beds on their wards, ESPECIALLY when those patients haven’t actually hurt themselves (yet). i’m not escalating this until i need to but my home team arent able to come out until tomorrow morning... 9 hours away. and even then they are likely to not get back to me or be booked up all day. my lifeline is gone. they said i could call them and they would visit me ‘any time’, but that’s twice now i’ve had to just sit through this. i’m being attacked by my own thoughts. every single one is pushing me and hurting me. should i just hurt myself and then call an ambulance lmao. that’s the only way i can force someone to make the change i need everyone ignores me and ignores me and blows me off until one day kill off half my liver and all of a sudden they strip my rights and i’m shut up in some hellish ward",suicide,"The post includes statements indicating a sense of hopelessness, frustration with the lack of support, and a desire to harm oneself in order to be taken seriously.

I've been sending money to girls online This past couple of weeks I have been sending quite a lot of money to pretty women online. I've been getting nothing in return for sending them money I just feel like I'm so much under their control just because of their looks and I can't seem to stop. It's gotten to a point where it's a fetish for me and I don't think I can stop. Something I haven't done yet but I think I would love to is to meet up with one of these girls to hand over some cash irl just so I could interact with them. I have recently stopped talking to them but I'm not sure when I will start sending money again because I don't know how it stop I'm not sure what the point of posting was but I guess just felt like I needed to tell someone.,no mental disorder,"The post primarily discusses a specific behavior of sending money to women online, without mentioning any symptoms or experiences commonly associated with mental disorders.
