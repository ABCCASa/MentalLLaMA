"2017 for me was the equivalent of putting a load of expensive and high-end ingredients into a pot, cooking it, and having it taste rancid in the end. I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want.

Christmas and New Year's are over, and I still feel this melancholy weight blanketing me that won't go away. But I'm expected to go to work parties and parties with friends and partake in festivities that I do not at all take pleasure in. I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want. And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt. Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not. I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought. I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water. I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter. But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come, Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb. I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay. To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown. So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone... Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand. Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband. But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down, To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown. Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do. Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue. That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert, To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt. However in both situations, I would simply end up dead. That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head. Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee, Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...",true,"The post expresses intense feelings of sadness, fear, and a desire for someone to come and save the poster from their dark thoughts.

I feel like I am so far behind and get caught up in the past. I need to be someone better, and I need to stop sulking. I feel that every time I try to get better, someone does something petty to set me off, and because of this, I have fallen into avoiding people. I don't want to be this person, and I'm so scared that I'm falling into a slump that I won't be able to pick myself out of.
